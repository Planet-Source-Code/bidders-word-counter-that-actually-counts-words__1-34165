## Word\-Counter that actually counts words


</div>

### Description

This is an update to Kurt Joseph Serge's word counter code that was long, clunky and not entirely accurate. Takes a string and counts the "words" (characters separated by spaces) in it. Take a look.
 
### More Info
 
Unless you uncomment the block i point out in the code, it will accept any character at all as a "word", assuming it isn't a space.
